# Immunity2024_Bistability
A tutorial written in MATLAB live script along with raw data to perform the modeling of experimental data and showcase the behavior of bistable metabolic circuits in innate immune cells (see [paper](https://www.cell.com/immunity/abstract/S1074-7613(24)00305-4)).

The bistability_tutorial+analysis.mlx is a MATLAB live script that contains code and the walkthrough of how we 1) developed the theory behind characterizing the bistable circuits induced by IL-18 and other cytokines, 2) designed the experiments to validate assumptions in our theory, and 3) performed mathematical modelling of the experimental data to test our theory. The .pdf is also available with the code hidden for better readability.

Please provide us any feedback, questions, concerns. You can email us at misraadi@mit.edu and/or at rnowarski@bwh.harvard.edu. Also let us know if you would like an open-source version of the code like in python. If there is enough demand we may devote effort to recreating the analysis in python.
